            <h1>Freedom Tied with a Bow</h1>
            <p>
                Brutally knowing, growing up comes with a lot of change. Hard it is to try and disentangle yourself 
                from the little you yet being drawn right back like a dog on a leash. I'm perpetually stuck in the moment.
            </p>

            <h2>Anxiously Awaiting the Age of Assurance</h2>
            <p>
                What if I'm not strong enough for what's ahead? I have lost control, and every emotion assaults me. 
                How badly I wanted to turn 20, seeing 'worthwhile' written in everything.
            </p>

            <h3>Organized Chaos of My Mind</h3>
            <p>
                My outlook has proved to be very different. Thoughts never come straight, arriving unexpectedly in knotted loops, 
                curling in upon themselves!

            <p>Guess it all makes perfect sense.</p>
