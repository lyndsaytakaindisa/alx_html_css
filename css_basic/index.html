            <h1>Freedom Tied with a Bow</h1>
            <p>
                Brutally knowing, growing up comes with a lot of change. Hard it is to try and disentangle yourself 
                from the little you yet being drawn right back like a dog on a leash. I'm perpetually stuck in the moment.
            </p>

            <h2>Anxiously Awaiting the Age of Assurance</h2>
            <p>
                What if I'm not strong enough for what's ahead? I have lost control, and every emotion assaults me. 
                How badly I wanted to turn 20, seeing 'worthwhile' written in everything.
            </p>

            <h3>Organized Chaos of My Mind</h3>
            <p>
                My outlook has proved to be very different. Thoughts never come straight, arriving unexpectedly in knotted loops, 
                curling in upon themselves!
            </p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Essentially your 20s is just understanding that you can’t plan your way through life like you think. It’s a long unlearning that control &amp; staying the same isn’t the key to life, but the ability to constantly evolve through changes.</p>&mdash; KAYA NOVA (@thekayanova) <a href="https://twitter.com/thekayanova/status/1475532644859490318?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
            
            <p>
                As we grow older, the weight of life’s expectations and responsibilities can feel overwhelming.
                The journey is a complex mix of change, self-doubt, and growth. Yet, it is also a time for self-discovery,
                where we learn what truly matters to us. Understanding that life’s path is not always linear can bring a 
                sense of peace amidst the chaos.
            </p>
            
            <p>Guess it all makes perfect sense.</p>
